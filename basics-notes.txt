HTML and CSS for Beginners

What HTML and CSS are
	Both computer languages used to write web pages. A markup language. Using the code to "mark up" tell the browswer how to display/show text and images on web pages.

	Not a programming langauge becuase you're not giving instructions to perform any actions. 
	Markup languages just tell the computer how you want things to look on the screen

Creating first files
	index.html
	style.css

	your stylesheet can be called anything but has to be saved with .css
	html sheet
		index is a default name for web pages
	images need to get stored somewhere so create an images folder within your folder for the website

HTML and CSS for Beginners

What HTML and CSS are
	Both computer languages used to write web pages. A markup language. Using the code to "mark up" tell the browswer how to display/show text and images on web pages.

	Not a programming langauge becuase you're not giving instructions to perform any actions. 
	Markup languages just tell the computer how you want things to look on the screen

Creating first files
	index.html
	style.css

	your stylesheet can be called anything but has to be saved with .css
	html sheet
		index is a default name for web pages
	images need to get stored somewhere so create an images folder within your folder for the website

Basic syntax for writing HTML
	Get used to brackets <<< (open) >>> (close) Almost all code uses these keys
	<!DOCTYPE html> Doc type declaration. Needed at top of EVERY html page - tells web browser you are using html and what kind. 

	Rest of page is made up of opening and closing tags <tag> </tag>  No spaces - better to not have spaces
	  Ex <tag>stuff goes here</tag>

Basic Tags needed. Tags almost always come in pairs
	<html></html>   Need at beginning and ending of every html page. This encloses everything in your page. Everything goes inside these tags. 

	<head></head>
	<body></body>

	How you nest things matters. When building an html page you have to have a head and a body. 
	The head tag is the administrative details. Stuff about the page. Meta information. (the stuff in your head). 
	The body is where you put the text, images, etc. 
	<title> goes within the head - its the title of your webpage and shows up in the title bar of the browser.

	These are the essential components in every single HTML page. This is your template. Accuracy in formatting and opening/closing all of these is critical. Tags are always in lower case. 

		<!DOCTYPE html>

		<html>
		<head>
			<title>Title</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			all the content
		</body>
		</html>

See what your code looks like.
	Take your index.html file and drag it on top of the web browswer you want to open it up. And you'll be able to preview your changes.

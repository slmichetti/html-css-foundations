HTML and CSS for Beginners

What HTML and CSS are
	Both computer languages used to write web pages. A markup language. Using the code to "mark up" tell the browswer how to display/show text and images on web pages.

	Not a programming langauge becuase you're not giving instructions to perform any actions. 
	Markup languages just tell the computer how you want things to look on the screen

Creating first files
	index.html
	style.css

	your stylesheet can be called anything but has to be saved with .css
	html sheet
		index is a default name for web pages
	images need to get stored somewhere so create an images folder within your folder for the website

Basic syntax for writing HTML
	Get used to brackets <<< (open) >>> (close) Almost all code uses these keys
	<!DOCTYPE html> Doc type declaration. Needed at top of EVERY html page - tells web browser you are using html and what kind. 

	Rest of page is made up of opening and closing tags <tag> </tag>  No spaces - better to not have spaces
	  Ex <tag>stuff goes here</tag>

Basic Tags needed. Tags almost always come in pairs
	<html></html>   Need at beginning and ending of every html page. This encloses everything in your page. Everything goes inside these tags. 

	<head></head>
	<body></body>

	How you nest things matters. When building an html page you have to have a head and a body. 
	The head tag is the administrative details. Stuff about the page. Meta information. (the stuff in your head). 
	The body is where you put the text, images, etc. 
	<title> goes within the head - its the title of your webpage and shows up in the title bar of the browser.

	These are the essential components in every single HTML page. This is your template. Accuracy in formatting and opening/closing all of these is critical. Tags are always in lower case. 

		<!DOCTYPE html>

		<html>
		<head>
			<title>Title</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			all the content
		</body>
		</html>

See what your code looks like.
	Take your index.html file and drag it on top of the web browswer you want to open it up. And you'll be able to preview your changes. 

Add Headers and Paragraphs
	Get used to always creating your tags in pairs. 
	Header Tag is <h1>. Every other header will be a subheader ex: <h2> Can go down to six levels through <h6>
	Save and reload the browswer to see your changes
	Browswers have default settings that separate your headers and paragraphs.

	Tag that lets you put text inside your web page thats not visible in the web browswer - commenting. Allows you to leave comments to yourself or instructions to others that might be reading your code. 
	Ex:
		<!--We need to figure out how to do a copyright symbol.--> These are visible in browser tools to view source code

	HTML for symbols and characters
		Google: HTML codes. You can use the HTML Name or Number in your code. Copy and paste that into your code on where its needed

	Adding hyperlinks
		"A tag" <a></a>  It requires more information
		Attributes - extra information you give to tags so that tag has customization
		attribute href <a href="></a>  Attribute value pairs. Value to an a or link tag requires a web address of where you want the link to a "href=http://www.somewebsite.com">whatever you wan to be the link (will get underlined) ex word LINK</a>

		Email links are similar. <a> </a> instead of a url you use href=mailto:emailaddress.com

	Adding Images
		The type of image you use is important. Web browswers can only display three types of images: jpeg, gif, png. Others are not consistently supported across browswers. 

		The image needs to be put in your images folder. All images need to be in that folder. 
		Image tag breaks the pair rule. Its a self closing tag. There are a lot of different attributes you can add - but there are four essential (mandatory) attribute value pairs needed.
			src = source; telling the browser what is the source of the image. Where is it located relative to this index.html file.
			image file name is case sensitive - needs to match exact to what is saved in your image file (no spaces)

			have to tell the browswer the size of the picture, given in pixels
			width="?" height="?"

			alt = a description of the image; loads in place of images that dont load

	Adding Icons to your site
		IconArchive.com for icons for your site. 
		cmd+I lets you see the image size of a file

Adding Clickable Links
	Links need the a tag and it gets wrapped around what you want to link. 
	Add the a tag to the beginning and end of your image

Checking HTML for errors
	Validating your Code - validators are useful to use when things aren't working the way you think they should be by finding the error. 
	W3C Markup Validation Service - free service. validato.w3.org
	Focus on one error at a time. Solve the easiest first then focus on the next.

CSS = Cascading Style Sheets. 
	Used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language like HTML

	Designed primarily to allow the separation of content and presentation (layout, colors, fonts, etc)

	Can be used to control the way a web page displays depending on viewer's screen size

Three ways to apply CSS to HTML
	in-line
	internal
	external (used for multiple page websites)

Both in-line and internal sytles are coded inside the HTML file (not in a separate css file)
	In-line styles are written inside HTL tags using the style attribute and apply to just one particular bit of content
		Ex: <p style="color:red">text</p>

	Internal styles (also called "embedded" styles) are written inside the head element using the style tag and apply to the whole page (but not to other pages on the same website)
		Ex:
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		<head>
		<title>CSS Example</title>

		p {
		color:red;
		}

		a {
		color:blue;
		}

		</style>

	Best Practice to keep content (HTML) and presentation (CSS) separate. Means avoiding in-line and internal and instead always use external style sheets wherever possible

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets

Connecting CSS style sheet to HTML page
	Telling the browser where to find your file is an "administrative" function, so adding the tag to link the style sheet to the HTML is done in the head

	The link tag is self closing.
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=/>
	rel = relationship
	type = the type of file it is
	href = the relative location of the css file (same directory you can just use the file name, but if you've got a folder stucture you have to add the folder then the file name)

CSS Syntax
	HTML has tags. CSS has selectors (its selecting the things you want to add style to)

	body {this will have an affect on everything int he body tag}
		Ex: change the background color of your site
		body {background-color: red}
		body - selector
		background-color = attribute. At the end of every attribute you need to put a :
		red=value  at the end of every value you need a ;

	h1 { }
		Ex: h1 {background-color: red;}

	Organizing your code - just like html, spacing doesnt matter. Put each attribute value pair on its own line.

	h1 {
		backgroud-color: red;
		background-color: red;
		background-color: red;
		}

	p {
		color: green;
		}

	Can comment on a stylesheet same as html - format is different
		/* this is a comment */

Changing Fonts on your web page
	Web safe fonts (w3schools.com is a great resource)
	Browsers rely on what fonts are installed on the users (who is on your site) computer. there are certain fonts that are common. Those are web-safe fonts combinations. These are the series of fonts you want to put in your css file. Using the combination ensures everyone has a similar experience for your styling.

	Adding fonts - font-family is the attribute

	Name your font in the order of preference. 
		body {
		font-family: font1, font2, font3;
		}

	Chaning the font size
	Use the attribute: font-size
	Percentage values ensure everything is relative/scales. 

	Ex:
	font-size: 300% 

Color Schemes
	Choosing a color palatte
	Tools:
	- colorexplorer.com -- allows you to use "Image color Import" where you upload a file and it extracts a palatte of colors that you can use on your website; complimentary colors. Site allows you to save and export the palatte. Download the image to give you the coloar and the number. Txt file gives you text thats easily copied, but no image. You can use the image to create a color refrence file.

	Changing colors on the webpage
	Adding background color
		color; is the attribute for text color. Putting it in the "head" will affect the text on all pages

	Affect links in css - type "a"  the a selector and it will affect anything within those a tags

Web Publishing
	to publish your page
		Register your domain name
		Find a web hosting provider to host your webpages (in this case the html and css files)

		Once youve done that, you'll need some way to get your files to the web host's server. Typically you'll use FTP to do this.

			FTP - File Transfer Protocol

		Cyberduck for FTP - download for free


Uploading and Downloading files using FTP

Separating sections of your webpage. Add DIVs
	Identify the sections you want on your page
	<div></div> you'll put the opening and closing around anything you want to identify as a section. 

	Label it - with an ID attribute. You decide what that attribute is and add to your css code to style it a certain way. 
	You can nest divs. Important to close them in the right order.

	To help - add a border while you are doing design. Helps you identify the areas for your <div>
	div {
	border-width: 1px;
	border-style: dashed;
	border-color: white;
	}

Changing background color for different divs
	Applying color to one specific div. You'll use the ID attribute value-pairs

	#main {
	*/ stuff goes here */
	}

	#priority {

	}

	#footer {

	}

Changing DIV Width
	Percentages allow the design to remain consistent and flow with size changes; responsive

	width: 75%

Centering Content inside of a DIV
	add the attribute value pair

	text-align: center

Centering an entire DIV (not just its content)
	add attribute:

	margin: auto;
		margin can have different values. but using auto when something has a width - the effect is it will center the entire div. 

Container Div
	to house changes for margins you would want to apply to all

Removing underlines from Links
	Text decoration - applies to the "a" attribute
	text-decoration: none:

Changing text case
	text transform attribute. ex h1 all lowercase 
	add attribute to h1
	text-transform: lowercase;
	all uppercase
	text-transform: uppercase;
	
Categorizing your web page using classes
	Classes in css  - can create your own in css
	. (start with a period that is an indicator to css that you are about to create a new class)
	.lowercase {
		text-transform: lowercase;
		}

	The class is then used in html
	ex class="lowercase" instead of in the style.css

	Whatever you name it has to correspond to the .classname and the class="" in the html

Floating an Image
	Can create a class (there are multiple ways to do this)
	Create a class that can be applied to elements and make them float to the right (or left)
	.right and use float attribute
	right {
		float: right;
		}

To get text to clear the image
	to ensure an area never overlaps an element above it
		Use clear element - which refers to anything on that side, you want to clear it

Add space inside and around divs
	Margins and Padding
	css uses the box model - divs are boxes. when you add margins to the div, it adds margin to the outside
	padding is the distance between the border and where your text starts
	margin = extra space on the outside

	Adding px of margin to images; but only adding that to images in a specific place. If you dont specify top, bottom, etc you can just type margin or padding and it applies it to all sides
	#footer img {
		margin: 5px;
		}

Make rounded corners to your divs 
	 To apply to all divs on the page
	 border-radius: 10px; imaginary distance between the center of the cirlce and the edge of the line
	 so the larger the px, the larger the circle

Tweaking line spacing for text on the webpage
	use the line-height attribute and add to the p selector

Changing a link appearance and behavior when its hovered over
	change behavior of links with the a tag
	changing the behavior of a link in just one section, you use the #id and specify

	Create a pseudo-class
		#priority a:hover {
			color: #color
			}

Adding Drop Shadow Effect
	Adding a drop shadow to a div
		remove your border lines that you were using while creating
		do this by changing the color to "transparent" - allows you to quickly add it back if you need to make edits and see the borders of the divs

	use the box-shadow attribute
		values for this attribute
			the first value is a pixel value - the horizontal offset. the distance the drop shadow is from the edge horizontally
			the second value is the vertical offset
			the third is the blur radius (the bigger the value the more the shadow is blurred)
			the final value defines the color with rgba value
				rgba (x, x, x, x);
					red green blue alpha
					alpha is the opacity value for that color
			typical drop shadow black in rgb is 0,0,0,
				1 = 100%
				.3 is equiv to 30%

Creating special effects with images
	Drop to snapshot image with an image 
	adding a border for your snapshot effect - to apply only to one image on your page
		create a class
		img.snapshot - creating a class specific to the image selectors in the html page
			define and add the border (border-width: 10px; border style: solid; border-color: #ffffff)
		you can add multiple classes - you just need to type them all out
		check your work and step through
		add box-shadow
		add margin if needed; if you want to add different amount of margins around an image, you can do that by having multiple values 
			margin: TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT (like a clock)
		tilt your image - using css3 - 
			vendor prefixes - a piece of code that you add in front of an attribute that makes it so specific web browsers will understand it. there are different prefixes for different browsers
				 -mox-    firefox
				 -webkit-   chrome and safari
				 -o-     opera
				 -ms-    internet explorer

			attribute is called transform: rotate (and specify the amount)
				-moz-transform: rotate(-5deg);
				-webkit-transform: rotate(-5deg); etc

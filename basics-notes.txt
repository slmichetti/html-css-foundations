HTML and CSS for Beginners

What HTML and CSS are
	Both computer languages used to write web pages. A markup language. Using the code to "mark up" tell the browswer how to display/show text and images on web pages.

	Not a programming langauge becuase you're not giving instructions to perform any actions. 
	Markup languages just tell the computer how you want things to look on the screen

Creating first files
	index.html
	style.css

	your stylesheet can be called anything but has to be saved with .css
	html sheet
		index is a default name for web pages
	images need to get stored somewhere so create an images folder within your folder for the website

Basic syntax for writing HTML
	Get used to brackets <<< (open) >>> (close) Almost all code uses these keys
	<!DOCTYPE html> Doc type declaration. Needed at top of EVERY html page - tells web browser you are using html and what kind. 

	Rest of page is made up of opening and closing tags <tag> </tag>  No spaces - better to not have spaces
	  Ex <tag>stuff goes here</tag>

Basic Tags needed. Tags almost always come in pairs
	<html></html>   Need at beginning and ending of every html page. This encloses everything in your page. Everything goes inside these tags. 

	<head></head>
	<body></body>

	How you nest things matters. When building an html page you have to have a head and a body. 
	The head tag is the administrative details. Stuff about the page. Meta information. (the stuff in your head). 
	The body is where you put the text, images, etc. 
	<title> goes within the head - its the title of your webpage and shows up in the title bar of the browser.

	These are the essential components in every single HTML page. This is your template. Accuracy in formatting and opening/closing all of these is critical. Tags are always in lower case. 

		<!DOCTYPE html>

		<html>
		<head>
			<title>Title</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			all the content
		</body>
		</html>

See what your code looks like.
	Take your index.html file and drag it on top of the web browswer you want to open it up. And you'll be able to preview your changes. 

Add Headers and Paragraphs
	Get used to always creating your tags in pairs. 
	Header Tag is <h1>. Every other header will be a subheader ex: <h2> Can go down to six levels through <h6>
	Save and reload the browswer to see your changes
	Browswers have default settings that separate your headers and paragraphs.

	Tag that lets you put text inside your web page thats not visible in the web browswer - commenting. Allows you to leave comments to yourself or instructions to others that might be reading your code. 
	Ex:
		<!--We need to figure out how to do a copyright symbol.--> These are visible in browser tools to view source code

	HTML for symbols and characters
		Google: HTML codes. You can use the HTML Name or Number in your code. Copy and paste that into your code on where its needed

	Adding hyperlinks
		"A tag" <a></a>  It requires more information
		Attributes - extra information you give to tags so that tag has customization
		attribute href <a href="></a>  Attribute value pairs. Value to an a or link tag requires a web address of where you want the link to a "href=http://www.somewebsite.com">whatever you wan to be the link (will get underlined) ex word LINK</a>

		Email links are similar. <a> </a> instead of a url you use href=mailto:emailaddress.com

	Adding Images
		The type of image you use is important. Web browswers can only display three types of images: jpeg, gif, png. Others are not consistently supported across browswers. 

		The image needs to be put in your images folder. All images need to be in that folder. 
		Image tag breaks the pair rule. Its a self closing tag. There are a lot of different attributes you can add - but there are four essential (mandatory) attribute value pairs needed.
			src = source; telling the browser what is the source of the image. Where is it located relative to this index.html file.
			image file name is case sensitive - needs to match exact to what is saved in your image file (no spaces)

			have to tell the browswer the size of the picture, given in pixels
			width="?" height="?"

			alt = a description of the image; loads in place of images that dont load

	Adding Icons to your site
		IconArchive.com for icons for your site. 
		cmd+I lets you see the image size of a file

Adding Clickable Links
	Links need the a tag and it gets wrapped around what you want to link. 
	Add the a tag to the beginning and end of your image

Checking HTML for errors
	Validating your Code - validators are useful to use when things aren't working the way you think they should be by finding the error. 
	W3C Markup Validation Service - free service. validato.w3.org
	Focus on one error at a time. Solve the easiest first then focus on the next.
